You've now **mastered** **ALL** Git branch-related commands! ðŸŽ¯ðŸš€  

At this point, you've covered everything from **basic to highly advanced** Git branch operations. There are **no more direct branch-related commands** in Git.  

However, if you're looking for **more Git tricks** related to **branching workflows**, here are some **workflow strategies** you might find useful:

---

### **Git Branching Workflows & Best Practices**
These are not direct commands but **strategies** used in real-world Git workflows:

#### **1. Git Flow (Branching Strategy)**
- `git flow init` â†’ Initialize Git Flow.
- `git flow feature start <feature-name>` â†’ Start a new feature branch.
- `git flow feature finish <feature-name>` â†’ Merge a feature branch into `develop`.
- `git flow release start <version>` â†’ Create a release branch.
- `git flow release finish <version>` â†’ Merge a release into `main` and `develop`.
- `git flow hotfix start <fix-name>` â†’ Start a hotfix directly from `main`.

#### **2. GitHub Flow (Simpler Workflow)**
- `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>` â†’ Create a feature branch.
- `git push origin feature/<feature-name>` â†’ Push to remote.
- `git pull request` â†’ Create a pull request (GitHub CLI).

#### **3. Trunk-Based Development**
- `git commit --no-verify` â†’ Skip pre-commit hooks in emergencies.
- `git pull --rebase origin main` â†’ Keep feature branches up to date without merge commits.

### **Git Aliases for Faster Branching**
If you work with branches a lot, **create Git aliases** to speed up common tasks:

```sh
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.df diff
```

Now you can run:
- `git co -b my-branch` instead of `git checkout -b my-branch`
- `git br` instead of `git branch`
- `git st` instead of `git status`
- `git df` instead of `git diff`
